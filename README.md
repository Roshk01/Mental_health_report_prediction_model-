# Mental_health_report_prediction_model-

## Problem Statement
The lack of an effective and comprehensive system for monitoring and improving mental fitness poses a significant challenge. Existing methods are often subjective and lack data-driven insights. To address this, we aim to develop a machine learning-based Mental Fitness Tracker that leverages data analysis and predictive models to provide personalized recommendations, enabling individuals to track and enhance their mental well-being efficiently.

## Project Overview
The Mental Fitness Tracker is a machine learning-based system that monitors and improves mental fitness. It utilizes data analysis and predictive models to provide personalized recommendations for enhancing mental well-being. By tracking various indicators and analyzing user data, the system aims to offer actionable insights and strategies for individuals to proactively manage their mental health.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Google Colab**: Google Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment that allows you to write and execute Python code online. It provides a free GPU and supports popular libraries, making it ideal for machine learning projects.

- **pandas**: pandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python. It provides data structures and functions to efficiently work with structured data, such as importing and exporting datasets, data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

- **matplotlib**: matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python. It offers a wide range of plotting functions to create various types of charts, graphs, and plots. It is often used to visualize data and model outputs in a clear and visually appealing manner.

- **scikit-learn**: scikit-learn is a popular machine-learning library in Python. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and algorithms for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. It also includes utilities for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

- **Linear Regression and Random Forest Algorithm**: Linear regression and random forest algorithm is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm used for predicting numerical values. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable and aims to find the best-fit line that minimizes the prediction errors.
